# Sock Pair Counter

## Overview

The `findSockPair` class is designed to count the number of pairs of socks with matching colors. Given an array of integers representing the color of each sock, the `CountSockPair` method calculates the total number of pairs.

## Method

### `CountSockPair(int n, int[] ar)`

Counts the number of pairs of socks with matching colors.

**Parameters:**
- `n`: the number of socks in the pile.
- `ar`: an array of integers representing the colors of each sock.

**Returns:**
- `int`: the number of pairs.

## Example Usage

```java
public class FindSockPair {

    public static int CountSockPair(int n, int[] ar) {
        // Implementation details as described in the class
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Sample Input
        int n = 10;
        int[] ar = {10, 20, 20, 10, 10, 30, 50, 10, 20, 30};

        // Sample Output
        int result = CountSockPair(n, ar);
        System.out.println("Number of sock pairs: " + result);
    }
}
```

## How to Use

1. Copy the `FindSockPair` class into your Java project.

2. Create an instance of the class or call the `CountSockPair` method directly, providing the necessary parameters.

3. Compile and run the Java program.

## Sample Output

For the provided sample input, the output will be:

```
Number of sock pairs: 4
```
